Used Test First Development (no code without the test first) to implement a Minesweeper game. The code was developed in the following way:

1. Write the test
2. Run the test (there is no implementation code, test does not pass)
3. Write just enough implementation code to make the test pass
4. Run all tests (tests pass)
5. Refactor
6. Repeat

This is written in Java and uses JUnit for automated unit test cases. 

To run this code:
1. CD (into the root directory)
2. (run) ./gradlew
