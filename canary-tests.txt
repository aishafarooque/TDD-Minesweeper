x exposeNeighbors calls expose on eight neighbors
x exposeNeighbors on top left cell calls expose only on existing cells
x exposeNeighbors on bottom right cell calls expose only on existing cells

x call setMines(0) and verify there are a total of 10 mines, where 0 is a seed value for random number generator.
x call setMines(0) and setMines(1) and verify there is at least one mine at a different location between the two calls
